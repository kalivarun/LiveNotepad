### Key Improvements:
- **Bold text**: `**Node.js**` works better directly in Markdown instead of within HTML tags.
- **Code block**: The `bash` command block is now enclosed properly with triple backticks, which is the standard for Markdown.

You can now add this to your `README.md` and push it to GitHub. This will display correctly with headings, bold text, and the Linux command formatted as a code block.
